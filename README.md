Katie Bush Designs Test
DOCUMENTATION:

Requirements:
Hi Lisa — 

Here are some things to note:
•	You should have received an invite to the Invision Project. 
•	Once you are in, you will be able to "Inspect" the designs
•	I am attaching a few screenshots from Inspect, here is a link to access their Support page with more info. If you get stuck, please let me know and we can hop on a quick Zoom call to review. 
•	I am attaching a zip folder with the Sketch files, and the assets (including fonts)
The ask for the site:
•	This is a single page scroll site
•	The navigation items at the top should link to their corresponding sections below as anchors 
•	The portfolio hovers should use logic so that no 2 colors hover next/above/below an item with the same hover color.
o	In other words, if the hover color is yellow, no items directly to the top, right, bottom, or left should also be yellow. So while yellow may be in the next row, no 2 yellow items should touch each other. Let me know if that doesn't make sense. 
•	Bonus points for an actual Google Map embed on the Contact section 
•	We are not including mobile comps, as we would like to see what you may come up with. Don't feel like you need to do each section in full, just a small example from each section
Thank you so much for your patience, and I look forward to your reply!

Best, 
Shahla

Comp notes:
PhotoPea did not load font family as it should display.
Did use font size as described from sketch file.

Page is responsive.  4 - breakpoints.  
(Personal Note: had this been a client design project another breakpoint would have been included, this was coded to show capability.  Also for screen sizes less than 768, I would have used the more icon and displayed navigation as a modal toggle show/hide).

Framework:
PHP
CSS
Javascript

For updating employee photos and for the company photos, just need to simply add elements to the PHP array, will auto populate on the page - no need to hand code.
Also, option to consider: if live side, would have preferred to use images on page rather than background elements in CSS, Why?  SEO - for the alt tag. But, at the same time,
the load page would be faster with CSS in bk. 

Company logos have no colors touching.  The test instructions stated no touching colors to left/right/above/below - however, diagonal was not in that overview, so hence, using an array - was able to accomplish task.  However, should this have been a live client site, the documentation would have outlined that the # of columns per row should be 4, 2 or 1. 
Embedding Google map – very easy and coded to fit each breakpoint.  
Minor differences from full screen design to the four different breakpoints.  On the smallest, the company section had to be put into block, as we want the map readable for the user. 

Did include icon files as well as common OG tags and meta tags. Whereas the metatags essentially play no role in SEO, it is a good practice to create for each page, as it does provide an overview/scope of the SEO for that page. 

Also, note, no sitemap.xml or robots file created. 
Please let me know if there are any other requests – I will be more than happy to accommodate!
Lisa
